# User Centric Front End Milestone Project

Welcome to my Front End Milestone Project. My website is made for the alternative rock band The Pixies. It is made to exhibit their music and videos, announce news and tour dates and be a point of contact for fans to sign up to their newsletter. 

## UX
This website will be used by fans and/or potential fans interested in listening to the Pixies music and keeping up to date with the band's tour dates and latest news announcements. It will also give fans an opportunity to sign up to an email newsletter and give contact information about their booking agents/managers.
