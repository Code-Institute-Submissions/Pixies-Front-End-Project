# User Centric Front End Milestone Project

Welcome to my Front End Milestone Project. My website is made for the alternative rock band The Pixies. It is made to exhibit their music and videos, announce news and tour dates and be a point of contact for fans to sign up to their newsletter. 

## UX
This website will be used by fans and/or potential fans interested in listening to the Pixies music and keeping up to date with the band's tour dates and latest news announcements. It will also give fans an opportunity to sign up to an email newsletter and give contact information about their booking agents/managers.

  * As a fan/potential fan, I want to learn about the latest band-related news such as announcements of new music and tour dates.â‹…*As a fan/potential fan, I want to be able to listen to the band's new music and have access to their back catalogue.
  * As a fan/potential fan, I want to to be able to watch music videos featuring the band including production videos and videos of their latest live performances. I also want to see photos from their instagram feeds and latest shows.
  * As a fan/potential fan, I want to check their latest tour dates and would like to have the ability to book tickets from the website. 
  * As a promoter/booker, I want to know who how to contact the band's management in order to potentially book them for events.
  * As a fan/potential fan/booker, I want to be able to access the band's social media pages in order to view their media and to see the kind of fan numbers their content generates.

## Wireframes
My project began with the wireframes in the links below but the design of the pages developed as I made them. I added the parallax scrolling banner image on every page after I made the wireframes as it made the top of the page where the user sees first more impressive. On the mobile wireframe design, I have the main Logo at the top of the page but eventually decided to hide it on mobile view as it wasn't necessary with the mini-logo in the top right hand corner. 
Another change I made from the wireframes was to split the 'Media' page into two pages; 'Listen' and 'Watch'. The 'Media' page would've been too big and visually confusing so I changed the 'Listen' page to just audio content and the 'Watch' page to video and photos of the band. I have added a wireframe of the 'Watch' page but the audio page is still labelled 'Media'.
The last change I made that deviated from my wireframes was to the Footer. I removed the music app links and added them to the Audio page and I added the email sign-up form and a 'Back-to-Top' button.

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Nav Bar
The Navigation Bar features a small image of 'The Pixies' logo in the top left with a link back to index.html. The menu for the website with each page is featured on the right of the Nav bar and collapse into a burger icon when in mobile view. Each page font is in grey and transitions to white when hovered over.

#### Parallax Banner Hero Image
Each page features a Hero Banner Image under the Nav Bar that make up the second part of the header. The Banner Image is an image of the band either performing live or from a photoshoot that provide a different visual experience for each page. The parallax effect makes the banner image move at a different speed than the rest of the website when scrolling. 
The 'Pixies' logo features underneath the Nav Bar and on top of the Banner Image and contains a link to the index.html. The Logo disappears on mobile view to avoid overcrowding the screen for users as the smaller logo in the navbar is enough to display the band's brand.

#### Footer Email Sign-Up
The Footer on each page features a form from Bootstrap's documentation that allows users to sign up to Pixies newsletter email for updates and news about the band and includes a data-based disclaimer about using the user's info. 

#### Footer Social Media links
The Footer features six Social Media links to the Pixies various social media and music streaming accounts: Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Instagram, Spotify and Youtube. The buttons are based on a Bootsnip.com code that I customised to suit the website. Each of the accounts are represented by their respective FontAwesome icons in white. When hovered over by the user, each icon expands and scales up and changes colour to the recognised color of the social media brand. The links open a new tab in the same browser window when clicked on.

#### Home Page
The home page features a customised Jumbotron from Bootstrap's documentation underneath the Hero advertising the band's latest album and a large "Listen" button in red underneath that stands out in contrast to the grey background. The home page also features the latest news updates with links to the "Listen" and "Tour" pages of the website as well as external links to the featured stories that open in a new tab when clicked. 

#### 'Listen' Page
The 'Listen' page features the audio content of the website. Each Pixies full studio album is embedded on this page from Spotify. The user can listen to 30 second clips of the songs from the embedded player if not signed in to Spotify or can visit Spotify from a link in the player. The user can listen to the full tracks if signed in to Spotify and there is an option to directly log in within the embedded player. In mobile view, the embedded albums display one per row but expand to two per row in medium view and then to three per row in desktop view. Each embedded album features buttons directly below them that link to various popular downloading and streaming sites where the user can purchase, download or stream the album.
Below the embedded albums are a more extensive list of links of where to download/purchase the band's music featured in larger buttons.

#### 'Watch' Page
The 'Watch' page features the visual content of the website, namely Video and Photos. The videos follow a similar formula to the embedded albums on the 'Listen' page, where the embedded videos have buttons below linking externally to puchasing/video streaming sites. The videos featured are a combination of live performances, official music videos and fan-made vidoes. 
Below the videos section is the Photos section where there is a photo carousel from bootstrap's documentation displaying photos of the band from recent gigs and photoshoots. 

#### 'Tour' Page
The 'Tour' page exhibits the band's tour dates and gives the user the opportunity to book tickets. The tour dates are displayed in a table from Bootstrap and is punctuated with a red "BOOK" button. 

#### 'Contact' Page
The contact page gives users/promoters the chance to get in touch with the band's management in order to book them for live shows. The page features the band's management contact details and also features a contact form for general queries. The form is from Bootstrap. 

### Features Left to Implement
#### Adding functionality to Email Sign-Up
I still need to make the forms functional and interactive. 

#### Parallax Banner Image Media Queries
Test Parallax Banner on different devices. 

#### Check Photo Carousel
Test Photo carousel's functionality on all devices.
